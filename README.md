## EduMind Metrics ~ Student Performance & Analysis Tracker
A comprehensive data visualization project developed to uncover how academics, health & lifestyle factors shape student success, offering a holistic view of scores, attendance, habits & well-being across different courses and universities.

### 1) Objective
EduMind Metrics is an engaging Power BI project designed to analyze student data from multiple universities and courses. It focuses on uncovering academic growth trends, the impact of lifestyle habits on performance, and the role of health and motivation in overall academic success. Built for educators, policymakers, counselors & researchers, this tool helps uncover academic trends, spotlight at-risk students & drive data-informed strategies to boost learning and student well-being.

### 2) Tech Stack
Key tools and technologies that powered this project include:
  - 🟩 **MS Excel:** Used for storing raw student data including academic, demographic, and health attributes.
  - 🧹 **Power Query Editor:** Data Cleaning & Transformation to refine data quality for furthur analysis.
  - 📊 **Power BI Desktop:** Primary visualization platform used to create interactive dashboards.
  - 🔗 **Data Modeling:** Connects tables like student_Demographics, disorders, student_scores to enable interactive filtering and powerful aggregations.
  - 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expression):** Used for calculated measures, KPIs, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic in dashboards.

### 3) Dataset
- The dataset provides a comprehensive view of 10,000 students spanning 3 types of institutions & 5 different Universities offering overall 40 distinct courses. It combines academic, lifestyle, demographic & health-related attributes, designed to analyze how different factors influence student academic performance and well-being.

### 4) Business problem
Educational institutions face increasing challenges in tracking student performance holistically. Traditional academic analysis often ignores critical lifestyle and health factors, leading to an incomplete picture of student success.
Without a centralized analytical view, it becomes difficult to:
  - Identify top-performing and at-risk students.
  - Understand the influence of sleep, exercise, and motivation on academic outcomes.
  - Recognize the role of disorders such as stress, anxiety, or depression on grades.
  - Optimize student engagement strategies for both academic and personal well-being.

### 5) Key Features
Following features have designed to make the dashboard interactive & insightful:

**a) Top Achievers dashboard**
  
  - **KPI Cards (Total Students, Average Score, Attendance, Activity Time, Course Revenue):** Provides a snapshot of overall academic and financial performance.

  - **Top 3 Students (Name, Percentage, CGPA, Student ID):** Highlights the best-performing students.

  - **Bar Chart (Course-wise Average Scores):** Compares student performance across programs such as BBA, BCom, MBA, MCA, and BSc etc..

  - **Matrix Table (Revenue Summary - University-wise Fee Contribution):** Breaks down course revenue generated by different universities (AMU, DU, IPU, LPU, SRMU).

**b) Student Metrics Dashboard**

  - **KPI Cards (Pass/Fail Count, Avg. Study Time, Screen Time, Sleep Hours):** Provides a quick overview of student performance and lifestyle habits.

  - **Line Chart (Study Time vs Overall Scores):** Shows how study hours correlate with academic performance.

  - **Gauge Visuals (Year-on-Year Score Comparison):** Evaluates academic progression across different batches.

  - **Multi-row card (Income Group Distribution):** Highlights the number of students from high, medium, and low-income backgrounds.

  - **Column Chart (CGPA by Attendance):** Demonstrates how attendance levels affect academic outcomes.

  - **Donut Chart (Screen Time Distribution):** Displays the proportion of students based on digital usage.

  - **Ribbon Chart (Exercise Frequency vs Scores):** Analyzes the relationship between physical activity and academic success across universities.

**c) Health Stats Dashboard**

  - **KPI Cards (Affected Students, Most Common Disorder, Avg. Sleep Time, Avg. Exercise Frequency, Avg. Shift Duration):** Provides a summary of student health indicators.

  - **Pie Chart (Disorder Distribution):** Breaks down prevalence of academic stress, anxiety, depression, panic attacks & substance addiction.

  - **Bar Chart (Age & Gender Distribution):** Shows demographic patterns among affected students.

  - **Matrix Table (Top 5 Disorders Impacting Grades):** Identifies the disorders with the most negative effect on academic outcomes.

  - **Area Chart (Sleep & Activity Analysis ):** Evaluates how rest influence performance.

  - **Bar Chart (Affected Students by Motivation Levels):** Displays the proportion of students with high, moderate & low motivation levels.

### 6) Use Case
By consolidating diverse datasets into interactive dashboards, this project empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions that enhance desicion making process for:
  - **Universities & Colleges →** Track academic success and improve student support systems.

  - **Counselors & Psychologists →** Identify students at risk of stress, depression, or burnout.

  - **Policy Makers →** Formulate strategies to improve student well-being and academic outcomes.

  - **Researchers →** Study correlations between lifestyle, health, and academic performance.
